You can embed your Dataverse into your website through an iframe. 

For instructions on how to set this up, go to [Edit Layout Branding page](http://guides.thedata.org/book/edit-layout-branding) of our User Guides and scroll down to the instructions on "create a page on your site and add the dataverse with an iframe." which is about half way down the page.
