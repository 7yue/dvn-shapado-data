Hi Phil,

We currently support data visualization for time series data only. Additionally, this data needs to be in a format we understand and can ingest: SPSS, Stata, CSV with SPSS control card, Tab delimited with DDI. Once ingested, the data owner would then configure the available variables and filters using the set up exploration option on the study's available actions box, where edit cataloging information is. Last, a user would click on the data visualization link on the study's data analysis tab next to the file to be visualized.

Regards,

Kevin
